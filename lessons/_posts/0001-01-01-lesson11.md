In order for the following code to work, you'll need to download [beep1.ogg](/media/beep1.ogg), [Jeopardy.ogg](/media/Jeopardy.ogg), and [Tetris.ogg](/media/Tetris.ogg) into the folder containing your Python file.

### Sound Effects

First, let's talk about sound effects: recordings you want to play in response to an event on screen.
In the following example, we ring a bell in response to key presses.

```python3
import sys
import pygame

# Initialize and set up screen.
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode([100, 100])

clock = pygame.time.Clock()

beep_effect = pygame.mixer.Sound('beep1.ogg')

# main game loop
while True:

  # event-handling loop
  for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
      pygame.quit()
      sys.exit()
    elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
      print("bing!")
      beep_effect.play()

  clock.tick(60)

```

If you want to add your own sound effects, note that pygame has limited support for different formats: only WAV and OGG files work.

### Background Music

Next, let's cover background music --- something you'd want to be playing for the entire game or throughout a level of the game.
Unlike the sound effects, this sound is *streamed* instead of loaded all at once --- that means that pygame can handle big and long sound files efficiently here.
However, you can only have a single piece of background music playing at once.

If we want to just have one piece of background music playing the whole time, it would look like this.

```python3
import sys
import pygame

# Initialize and set up screen.
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode([100, 100])

clock = pygame.time.Clock()


pygame.mixer.music.load('Jeopardy.ogg')
pygame.mixer.music.play(-1) # how many loops to play? -1 means infinity

# main game loop
while True:

  # event-handling loop
  for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
      pygame.quit()
      sys.exit()

  clock.tick(60)
```

If we want to switch between two tracks (maybe on different levels, in different game modes, or between the title and game play screens) we use `itertools.cycle` to change out the currently playing track for an alternate on a keypress.

```python3
import sys
import pygame
import itertools

# Initialize and set up screen.
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode([100, 100])

clock = pygame.time.Clock()

filenames = itertools.cycle(['Tetris.ogg', 'Jeopardy.ogg'])

# main game loop
while True:

  # event-handling loop
  for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
      pygame.quit()
      sys.exit()
    elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
      print("switch tracks")
      pygame.mixer.music.stop()
      pygame.mixer.music.load(next(filenames))
      pygame.mixer.music.play(-1)

  clock.tick(60)
```

If you want to add your own background music, note that PyGame has limited support for different formats: only MP3 (some), OGG, XM, and MOD files work.
